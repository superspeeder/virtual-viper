# Virtual Viper

Our idea is a reimplementation/reskin of Snake, with an expansive use of it's mechanics. Rather than having a snake move through space to collect food to grow, in this version, you control an AI program that moves through metaphorical computational/internet knowledge space to collect new algorithms, knowledge, and upgrades. The gameplay mimics Snake in that you move around with your arrow keys to collect more knowledge and "grow", which increases your size, but unlike Snake, there will be a variety of different things that you can collect or encounter, like algorithm upgrades that make you faster/more reactive, or compress your length without reducing score, as well as viruses that can harm you, and many other possible objects.
